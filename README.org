* Generalized automatic execution in a single frame

This is a library that package developers can use to provide user
friendly single window per frame execution of buffer exposing
commands, as well as to use in personal emacs configurations to attain
the same goal for packages that don't use =fullframe= or the likes of
it themselves.

Example: Setup =magit-status= to open in one window in the current
frame when called:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'fullframe)
  (fullframe magit-status magit-mode-quit-window)
#+END_SRC

** API

Fullframe exposes one function, =fullframe=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (fullframe enter-command
               exit-command
               &optional kill-buffer-after-exit-command 
                         after-command-on-func)
#+END_SRC

- =enter-command= is the function you want to execute in a single window in the current frame.
- =exit-command= is the name of a function which, when called, should restore the window configuration.
- =kill-buffer-after-exit-command= can be set to true if
  =exit-command= does not kill the buffer =enter-command= created, and
  you want that buffer gone.
- =after-command-on-func= will be called after =commansd-on= was
  called and the buffer generated by it is visible in the only window
  in the current frame

*** =after-command-on-func= example

This call will show the current buffer and the =rgrep= result only; if the =rgrep= result buffer is closed (with =q=), the previous window configuration is restored.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (fullframe rgrep quit-window
             nil
             (lambda ()
               (let ((wconf (fullframe/current-buffer-window-config))
                     (new-window (split-window-below)))
                 (set-window-buffer new-window "*grep*")
                 (fullframe/erase-current-buffer-window-config)
                 (with-current-buffer "*grep*"
                   (fullframe/set-current-buffer-window-config wconf)))))
#+END_SRC

** Installation

=fullframe= is available on [[http://melpa.org/#/fullframe][melpa]]. [[http://melpa.org/#/getting-started][Add melpa to your package sources]],
then execute the following in emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  M-x package-install<CR> fullframe<CR>
#+END_SRC

If you use =cask= for your package-management, make sure you have
=(source 'melpa)= in your =Cask= file and add

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (depends-on "fullframe")
#+END_SRC 

to it.
